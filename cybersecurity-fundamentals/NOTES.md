WHAT IS CYBERSECURITY
------------------------------------------
```
Cyber Security refers to the set of techniques used to protect the integrity of networks, programs and data from attack, damage and unauthoried access.

It can also be defined as the protection of information assets by addressing threats to information processed, stored and transported by inter-networked information systems.
```

WHY CYBERSECURITY?
------------------------------------------
```
1. Increased rate of cyber crimes
2. Increased demand to protect data
3. Presence of crime syndicates
4. Presence of cyber armies
5. Presence of financial frauds
```

INFORMATION SECURITY
------------------------------------------
```
Information security often refers to the processes and tools designed and deployed to protect sensitive business information from modification, disruption, destruction and inspection.

It deals with information regardless of its format: paper documents, digital and intellectusl property in people's minds, or verbal or visiual communication.

Cybersecurity is a component of information security
```


FACTORS AFFECTING CYBERSECURITY
------------------------------------------
```
1. Technology
    - Platforms and tools
    - Network connectivity
    - Level of IT complexity
    - New or emerging security tools
    - Operational support for seceurity
2. Business Plans
    - Nature of business 
    - Risk tolerance
    - Industry trends
    - Mergers acquisitions and partnerships
    - Outsourcing service providers
```


THE CIA TRIAD
------------------------------------------
```
1. C -> Cofidentiality
    - The principle of confidentiality asserts that information and functions can be accessed only by those who are authorized or third parties, e.g military secrets
2. I -> Integrity
    - The principle of integrity asserts that the information and functions can be added, removed or altered only by authorized people and processes
3. A -> Availability
    - The principle of availability asserts that the system, the functions and the data must be available on demand, according to the agreed upon parameters, based on levels of service

This triad is the basis for creating a wholistic security plan to protect all of your orgaanisation's critical and sensitive assets.
```


GOVERNANCE, RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE (GRC)
------------------------------------------------
```
GRC of every organisation is different, and varies based on the type of organisation It depends on the organisation's:
1. Mission
2. Industry
3. Size
4. Culture
5. Legal regulations

The responsibility of any GRC program is to protect assets and operations, including IT infrastructure and information.
```


GOVERNANCE
------------------------------------------
```
Governance is the responsibility of the Board of Directors and senior management of an organisation.

Goals of Governance
    - Provide strategic direction
    - Ensure that objectives are achieved
    - Ascertain that the risk is managed properly
    - Verify that the resources are used responsibly
```


RISK MANAGEMENT
------------------------------------------
```
Risk Management is the process by which the organisation manages risk to acceptable levels. 

Risk management requires the development implementation of internal controls to manage and mitigate risks throughout the organisation, including:
1. financial and investment risk
2. physical risk, and
3. cyber risk
```


COMPLIANCE
------------------------------------------
```
Compliance is the act of adhering to, and the ability to demonstrate adherance to, mandatory requirements defined by laws and regulations.

It also includes voluntary requirements resulting from contractual obligations and internal policies
```


APPROACHES TO CYBERSECURITY
------------------------------------------
```
1. Compliance-based cybersecurity
    - This approach relies on regulations or standards to determine the security implementation
2. Risk-based cybersecurity
    - This approach relies on identifying the unique risk a particular organisation faces and designing and implementing security controls to address the risk that you find.
3. Ad-hoc Approach
    - Implements security with no particular rationale or criteria
