THE CIA TRIAD
------------------------------------------
```
1. C -> Cofidentiality
    - The principle of confidentiality asserts that information and functions can be accessed only by those who are authorized or third parties, e.g military secrets
2. I -> Integrity
    - The principle of integrity asserts that the information and functions can be added, removed or altered only by authorized people and processes
3. A -> Availability
    - The principle of availability asserts that the system, the functions and the data must be available on demand, according to the agreed upon parameters, based on levels of service

This triad is the basis for creating a wholistic security plan to protect all of your orgaanisation's critical and sensitive assets.
